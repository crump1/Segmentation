# Segmentation

Customer segmentation using R code. Both statistical and managerial approaches are applied. 

Three examples of segmentation are included. 

The two statistical examples use hierarchical clustering to group customers who are similar to one another. Both clustering examples visualize the hierarchical output with a dendrogram, serving to illustrate the arrangement of clusters. 

A recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) value framework is used for the managerial example, as well as one of the statistical segmentations. Variables from both of these RFM examples are constructed using SQL syntax.
